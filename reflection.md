This assignment is quite a jump from python to java. The two programming language varies a lot in terms of the usage of different built-in functions. I consult a lot on the VS code instructions and online functions dictonaries like oracle. This assignment is a good refresher for java materials, especially with the usage of contructors, methods, array list, and so on. This assignment is also a good refresher for the materilals learned in CSC 110, for exmaple string functions, if-else, and for loop. In general, the part where I felt good is planning the overall structure and what big elements I need for the code, but I struggled with the details and how to make the big idea comes true. The "Quick Fix" function in VS code helps to fix small errors, and printing to the terminal help me to know where I should fix.
