This assignment is quite a jump from python to java. The two programming language varies a lot in terms of the usage of different built-in functions. Python is a more straight forward language that simplify the rules of using built in functions and creating methods. However, java has more programming rules due to its object oriented characteristic. If wanting to use or create functions and methods in java, we first need to create an object that the methods and functions can be call to. Python has a prodcedural coding style, where all created methods are serving the procedural codes written in the main function. However, java is more like a tree, where the all the created objects and methods are linked together to serve the code in its entirety. 

I consult a lot on the VS code instructions and online functions dictonaries like oracle. This assignment is a good refresher for java materials, especially with the usage of contructors, methods, array list, and so on. This assignment is also a good refresher for the materilals learned in CSC 110, for exmaple string functions, if-else, and for loop. In general, the part where I felt good is planning the overall structure and what big elements I need for the code, but I struggled with the details and how to make the big idea comes true. The "Quick Fix" function in VS code helps to fix small errors, and printing to the terminal help me to know where I should fix.
